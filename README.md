Course of European Macroeconomics: slides and materials


The general repository has three different folders, specific to each class or topic. Every folder contains both the respective slides and the main references to study. 
Moreover, I add also a repository for each class with further literature that students might use to deepen their knowledge on such topics. Needless to say, this further suggested literature is not part of the exam.
